/*
 * CS 132 Complex Fraction Assignment
 * Primary File for use with the FractionalComplex class
 *
 * This file is the primary file for use with the student created
 * class FractionalComplex class.   It is designed to test
 * all of the possible operators needed for that class.
 *
 * it is divded into pieces so that it can be done in sections.
 * each "section" contains different parts of the requirement.
 *
 * Students may only alter this file by removing commented sections
 * as they implement more and more parts of their code.
 * The primary code should be untouched
